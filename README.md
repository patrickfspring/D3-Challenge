Examining Health Trends through Census Data Journalism

The purpose of this was to create a D3 scatter plot to investigate census data to analyze overall health trends based on rates of income, obesity, poverty, smoking, and age at the state level.  This page will load
(and refresh) based on comparing poverty to lack of healthcare.  Circles in the D3 scatter plot represent states (using state abbreviations).

The contents of this webpage are as follows:
(1.) Under assets folder, the css subfolder contains the d3Style and style files - these are being reused (no changes). 
(2.) Under assets folder, the js subfolder contains the eslintrc.json file and the js application. The core of the work was done in the js application.  
(3.) In the index html file, relevant filler text was used in place of Lorem Ipsum text. 
(4.) Information for this effort is from the U.S. Census Bureau and Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. The data is based on 2014 ACS 1-year estimates from
the US Census Bureau (https://data.census.gov/cedsci/) in a csv file in the data subfolder under assets.

To run this visualization, use 'python -m http.server' from the terminal.  This will host the page at 'localhost:8000' in the web browser session.
