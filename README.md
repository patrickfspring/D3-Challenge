# D3-Challenge
D3 Challenge

The purpose of this project was to construct a D3 scatter plot to investigate census data to analyze overall health trends based on rates of income, obesity, poverty, smoking, and age at the state level.  This page will load (and refresh) based on comparing poverty to lack of healthcare.

The project contents are as follows:
(1.) Under assets folder, the css subfolder contains the d3Style and style files - no changes were needed in these. 
(2.) Under assets folder, the js subfolder contains the eslintrc.json file and the js application. The core of the assignment work was done in the js applicaiton.  No changes were done to the eslintrc json file.
(3.) For the index html file, more relevant filler text was incorporated to cut down on the redundancy of the Lorem Ipsum text. 
(4.) The data source is a 2014 census data.csv file in the data subfolder under assets.

Commented out code was retained in the project as Smokes vs Age was also reviewed as a possible scatterplot for submission.
